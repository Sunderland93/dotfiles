# Scratchpad:
#
# Sway has a "scratchpad", which is a bag of holding for windows.
# You can send windows there and get them back later.

# Move the currently focused window to the scratchpad
$bindsym $mod+Shift+minus move scratchpad

# Show the next scratchpad window or hide the focused scratchpad window.
# If there are multiple scratchpad windows, this command cycles through them.
$bindsym $mod+minus scratchpad show
